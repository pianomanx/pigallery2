[Try our live demo!](https://pigallery2.onrender.com/) (First load may take up to 60s while the server boots up)

## Key Features

### Photo Viewer
Nice photo viewer with an optional information panel that shows all important information about the photo.

### Map
PiGallery2 reads the location data of the photos and puts them on a nice map.
It supports **OpenStreetMap** and **Mapbox** by default, but you can also add your own favorite map provider.
The gallery also supports `.gpx` files to show your tracked path on the map. It recognizes different types of activities (e.g., running, flying) from the `.gpx` files and shows them with different colors and icons.

### Advanced Searching

```

### Folder Sorting
Add an empty file like `.order_[ORDER].pg2conf` to a folder to override the default sorting for that folder. It's not recursively applied to subfolders.
Replace `[ORDER]` with one of the following:
- `descending_name`
- `ascending_name`
- `descending_date`
- `ascending_date`
- `random`

### Sharing
You can share your photo folders with your friends. Sharing links can be password protected.

### Blog
Add `.md` files to your directory and the app will show them. You can tag sections in the `.md` files with `<!-- @pg-date <ISO_DATE> -->` to attach them to a date.

### Logical Albums
Create logical albums (Saved Search) from any search query.

### Faces
Reads Adobe's XMP Face region metadata and shows face bounding boxes over images.

### Photo Frame
Generate a photo frame link for the given directory or search result to automatically show and loop through photos.
Recommended usage with a [Kiosk app](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/).
Search for `(person:John or person:Kate) and last-7-days:every-year`, then Menu -> Tools -> Photo Frame.
